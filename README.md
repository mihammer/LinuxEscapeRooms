There are now 2 different escape room challenges. 

First
AssessmentFun folder contains fun challenges that cover the foundations assessment. 
Start this by running:  
    python3 assessment.py

This will give you a menu and you can select which module from the class you want to review. 


Second
The LinuxEscapeRooms folder has a different set of challenges. This coveres the basic material covered in foundations, but no necessarily everything in the final assessment. 
Start this by running
    python3 linuxescaperoom.py

This will give you a menu and you can select which challenge you want to run. 


The easiest way to use this is clone the whole repo to your WSL: 

From WSL:  
git clone https://github.com/mihammer/LinuxEscapeRooms.git

You will now have necessary folders. 

Enjoy!
