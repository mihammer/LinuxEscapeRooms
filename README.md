These .py files are a fun little set of cli escape room challenges. 
These cover the initial training for MS Azure VM foundations 

To play, download the files and execute with: 
python3 filename.py

The easiest way to use this is close the whole repo to your WSL: 

From WSL:  
git clone https://github.com/mihammer/LinuxEscapeRooms.git

You will now have a folder named LinuxEscapeRooms. 
cd to that directory and run each by: 
python3 filename.py

You can also give starthere.sh and run from there. You will need to make it executible. 

Enjoy!
